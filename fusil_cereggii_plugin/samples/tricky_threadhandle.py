"""
This module generates and orchestrates scenarios to abuse cereggii.ThreadHandle.

The primary goal is to violate its core contract: "a handle should only be
used by the thread that created it". We will test this via concurrency, and also
probe its robustness against wrapping tricky objects and handling object lifecycle
issues (use-after-free).
